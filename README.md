Welcome to slamjam - My personal playground for exploring Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and other computer vision systems!

slamjam is a repository dedicated to diving deep into the fascinating world of computer vision, particularly focusing on SLAM algorithms.

#### What is SLAM?
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a fundamental problem in robotics and computer vision. It involves the real-time construction or updating of a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within that environment.
